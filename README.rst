What is Avalon
Avalon is a programming language that targets hybrid classical-quantum computers. These computers contain a classical processor that tells a quantum processor what to do.

Avalon has a syntax similar to that of Python so if you know Python, you should be at ease working with it.
It is statically typed though hence a bit more strict with compile time errors. But it also features type inference so you don't need to provide the type unless necessary.

Why Avalon
Quantum computing is progressing and it needs tools among which programming languages are going to play a vital role. Yes, there exists other programming 
languages that target hybrid classical-quantum computers but I have found them to be lacking in abstractions and many even exposing hardware primitives making them unfriendly to the novice developer.
